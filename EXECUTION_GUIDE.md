## ‚ö° Quick Start (Run in 2 minutes)

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
2. **Navigate to project folder**: `cd go-calculator`
3. **Run the calculator**: `go run main.go calculator.go`
4. **Test it**: Enter numbers and operations as prompted

## üß™ Step-by-Step Execution

### Step 1: Verify Go Installation
```bash
go version
# Expected output: go version go1.21.0 (or higher)
```

### Step 2: Initialize and Verify Project
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory
cd go-calculator

# Check that go.mod exists
cat go.mod

# Verify all source files are present
ls -la *.go
```

### Step 3: Run Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
go test

# Expected output:
# PASS
# ok      go-calculator   0.002s

# Run tests with detailed output
go test -v

# Check test coverage
go test -cover
```

### Step 4: Run the Calculator
```bash
# Method 1: Direct run (recommended for development)
go run main.go calculator.go

# Method 2: Build then run (creates executable)
go build -o calculator
./calculator        # Linux/Mac
calculator.exe      # Windows
```

## üéÆ Testing the Calculator

### Example Test Session
```
üßÆ Welcome to Go Calculator!
================================

Choose an option:
1. Perform calculation
2. View supported operations
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1-3): 1

Enter first number: 10
Enter operation (+, -, *, /, ^): +
Enter second number: 5
‚úÖ Result: 10.00 + 5.00 = 15.00

Would you like to perform another calculation? (y/n): y

Enter first number: 12
Enter operation (+, -, *, /, ^): /
Enter second number: 0
‚ùå Error: division by zero is not allowed

Would you like to perform another calculation? (y/n): n

Choose an option:
1. Perform calculation
2. View supported operations
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1-3): 3
Thank you for using Go Calculator! Goodbye! üëã
```

### Test All Operations
1. **Addition**: `10 + 5 = 15`
2. **Subtraction**: `10 - 3 = 7`
3. **Multiplication**: `4 * 6 = 24`
4. **Division**: `15 / 3 = 5`
5. **Power**: `2 ^ 3 = 8`
6. **Error Case**: `10 / 0 = Error message`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: "go: command not found"
**Solution**: Go is not installed or not in PATH
```bash
# Check if Go is installed
which go    # Linux/Mac
where go    # Windows

# If not found, reinstall Go from https://golang.org/dl/
```

### Problem: "package main is not a main package"
**Solution**: Check file structure and package declarations
```bash
# Verify first line of main.go and calculator.go
head -1 main.go calculator.go
# Both should show: package main
```

### Problem: Tests failing
**Solution**: Run tests individually to identify issues
```bash
# Run specific test
go test -run TestCalculator_Add
go test -run TestCalculator_Divide
```

### Problem: "no Go files in /path"
**Solution**: Ensure you're in the correct directory
```bash
pwd                    # Check current directory
ls *.go               # List Go files
cd go-calculator       # Navigate to project if needed
```

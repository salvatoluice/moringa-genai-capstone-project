# Getting Started with Go Programming ‚Äì A Beginner's Guide to Building a Calculator

## 1. Title & Objective

**Technology**: Go (Golang) Programming Language  
**Project**: Interactive Command-Line Calculator  
**Why Go?**: Go is an excellent choice for beginners because of its simple syntax, fast compilation, strong standard library, and excellent error handling. It's used by companies like Google, Docker, Kubernetes, and many startups for backend services.  
**End Goal**: Build a fully functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^) with proper error handling and user-friendly interface.

## 2. Quick Summary of the Technology

**What is Go?**  
Go (also called Golang) is a programming language developed by Google in 2009. It's designed to be simple, efficient, and reliable for building software that scales.

**Where is it used?**  
- **Web servers and APIs** (companies like Uber, Netflix)
- **Cloud infrastructure** (Docker, Kubernetes)
- **Microservices** (Dropbox, SoundCloud)
- **Command-line tools** (GitHub CLI, Terraform)
- **Database systems** (CockroachDB, InfluxDB)

**Real-world example**: Docker, the popular containerization platform, is written entirely in Go. When you run `docker run`, you're using Go code!

## 3. System Requirements

**Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows  
**Required Tools**:
- Go compiler (version 1.19 or higher)
- Text editor (VS Code recommended) or any IDE
- Terminal/Command prompt
- Git (optional, for version control)

**Hardware Requirements**:
- Minimum 2GB RAM
- 500MB free disk space
- Internet connection for downloading Go

## 4. Installation & Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Go

**For Windows:**
1. Visit https://golang.org/dl/
2. Download `go1.21.windows-amd64.msi`
3. Run the installer and follow default settings
4. Open Command Prompt and verify: `go version`

**For macOS:**
1. Visit https://golang.org/dl/
2. Download `go1.21.darwin-amd64.pkg`
3. Run the installer
4. Open Terminal and verify: `go version`

**For Linux:**
```bash
# Download and extract
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Add to PATH
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify installation
go version
```

### Step 2: Setup Development Environment

**Install VS Code (Recommended)**:
1. Download from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install Go extension by Google
3. Open VS Code and install Go tools when prompted

### Step 3: Create Project

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir go-calculator
cd go-calculator

# Initialize Go module
go mod init go-calculator

# Create main files
touch main.go calculator.go calculator_test.go
```

## 5. Minimal Working Example

### What the Example Does
Our calculator performs basic arithmetic operations through an interactive command-line interface. Users can:
- Choose operations from a menu
- Enter two numbers
- Select an operation (+, -, *, /, ^)
- Get calculated results with error handling

### Core Calculator Functions (calculator.go)
```go
package main

import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"
)

type Calculator struct{}

func NewCalculator() *Calculator {
    return &Calculator{}
}

// Basic arithmetic operations
func (c *Calculator) Add(a, b float64) float64 {
    return a + b
}

func (c *Calculator) Divide(a, b float64) (float64, error) {
    if b == 0 {
        return 0, errors.New("division by zero is not allowed")
    }
    return a / b, nil
}

// Additional operations: Subtract, Multiply, Power...
```

### Main Program (main.go)
```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "strconv"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("üßÆ Welcome to Go Calculator!")
    calculator := NewCalculator()
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
    
    // Interactive menu loop
    for {
        fmt.Println("1. Perform calculation")
        fmt.Println("2. Exit")
        // Handle user input and calculations...
    }
}
```

### Expected Output
```
üßÆ Welcome to Go Calculator!
================================

Choose an option:
1. Perform calculation
2. View supported operations  
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1-3): 1

Enter first number: 10
Enter operation (+, -, *, /, ^): +
Enter second number: 5
‚úÖ Result: 10.00 + 5.00 = 15.00
```

### Running the Program
```bash
# Method 1: Direct run
go run main.go calculator.go

# Method 2: Build then run
go build -o calculator
./calculator
```

## 7. Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "go: command not found"
**Problem**: Go not installed properly or not in PATH  
**Solution**: 
- Reinstall Go following official instructions
- Add Go to system PATH: `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin`
- Restart terminal/command prompt

### Issue 2: "package main is not a main package"
**Problem**: Incorrect package declaration  
**Solution**: Ensure first line of main.go is `package main` and you have a `main()` function

### Issue 3: "invalid character '√Ø' looking for beginning of value"
**Problem**: File encoding issues (BOM in UTF-8)  
**Solution**: Save files as UTF-8 without BOM in your editor

### Issue 4: Division by zero not handled
**Problem**: Calculator crashes on division by zero  
**Solution**: 
```go
func (c *Calculator) Divide(a, b float64) (float64, error) {
    if b == 0 {
        return 0, errors.New("division by zero is not allowed")
    }
    return a / b, nil
}
```

### Issue 5: Tests failing
**Problem**: Test file not recognized  
**Solution**: Ensure test file ends with `_test.go` and functions start with `Test`

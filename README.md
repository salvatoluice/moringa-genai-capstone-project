#  Go Calculator

A simple, interactive command-line calculator built with Go programming language. This project demonstrates basic Go programming concepts including functions, error handling, user input/output, and unit testing.

##  Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Advanced Operations**: Power/Exponentiation
- **Error Handling**: Division by zero protection and input validation
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all calculator functions
- **Input Validation**: Handles invalid inputs gracefully

##  Prerequisites

Before running this calculator, make sure you have:

- **Go Programming Language** (version 1.19 or higher)
  - Download from: https://golang.org/dl/
  - Verify installation: `go version`

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or Download the Project**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:salvatoluice/moringa-genai-capstone-project.git
   cd moringa-genai-capstone-project
   ```

2. **Initialize Go Module** (if not already done)
   ```bash
   go mod init go-calculator
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

##  How to Run

### Method 1: Direct Run
```bash
go run main.go calculator.go
```

### Method 2: Build and Execute
```bash
# Build the executable
go build -o calculator

# Run the executable
./calculator        # On Linux/Mac
calculator.exe      # On Windows
```

##  Running Tests

Execute all unit tests:
```bash
go test
```

Run tests with verbose output:
```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:
```bash
go test -cover
```

##  How to Use

1. **Start the Calculator**
   - Run the program using one of the methods above
   - You'll see the welcome message and main menu

2. **Choose an Option**
   - `1`: Perform calculation
   - `2`: View supported operations
   - `3`: Exit

3. **Perform Calculations**
   - Enter first number
   - Enter operation (+, -, *, /, ^)
   - Enter second number
   - View the result

4. **Example Usage**
   ```
   Enter first number: 10
   Enter operation (+, -, *, /, ^): +
   Enter second number: 5
   ✅ Result: 10.00 + 5.00 = 15.00
   ```

## 🔧 Supported Operations

| Operation | Symbol | Description | Example |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Addition | `+` or `add` | Adds two numbers | 5 + 3 = 8 |
| Subtraction | `-` or `subtract` | Subtracts second from first | 5 - 3 = 2 |
| Multiplication | `*` or `multiply` | Multiplies two numbers | 5 * 3 = 15 |
| Division | `/` or `divide` | Divides first by second | 6 / 3 = 2 |
| Power | `^` or `power` | Raises first to power of second | 2 ^ 3 = 8 |

##  Error Handling

The calculator handles various error cases:

- **Division by Zero**: Returns error message "division by zero is not allowed"
- **Invalid Numbers**: Prompts user to enter valid numeric values
- **Unsupported Operations**: Shows error for operations not supported
- **Empty Input**: Validates and handles empty input fields
